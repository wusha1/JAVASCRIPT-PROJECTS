# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS
This repository contains coding projects, assignments, and challenges completed during my JavaScript course at The Tech Academy.

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress in learning JavaScript concepts such as functions, variables, loops, objects, and basic game and web interactivity.

All code submitted throughout this course will be stored here for instructor review and portfolio development.
